1. [The Linux Filesystem Explained](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/)<br>
   A filesystem or fs controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. Let's learn more about filesystem especially Linux on this article made by Linux itself!
2. [Understanding Linux filesystem](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/ext4-filesystem)<br>
   The majority of modern Linux distributions default to the ext4 filesystem, just as previous Linux distributions defaulted to ext3, ext2, and � if you go back far enough � ext. This article cover almost everything on filesystems and a very good pre-knowledge for us before continuing to our next learnings.
3. [Mount and Unmount File System in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)<br>
   On Linux and UNIX operating systems, you can use the mount command to attach (mount) file systems and removable devices such as USB flash drives at a particular mount point in the directory tree. The unmount command detaches (unmounts) the mounted file system from the directory tree. In this tutorial, we will go over the basics of attaching and detaching various file systems using the mount and unmount commands. 
4. [Unified Buffer Cache](http://www.mallorn.com/People/lindsey/test/c0504.htm)<br>

5. [Free Space Management in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
   The system keeps tracks of the free disk blocks for allocating space to files when they are created. Also, to reuse the space released from deleting the files, free space management becomes crucial. The system maintains a free space list which keeps track of the disk blocks that are not allocated to some file or directory. This GeeksforGeeks article covers what free space list can be implemented as.

## Week 4

3. [What is fragmentation and what are its types?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-fragmentation-and-what-are-its-types)<br>
   In contiguous memory allocation whenever the procceses come into RAM, space is allocated to them. These spaces in RAM are divided either on the basis of fixed partitioning or dynamic partitioning. As the process gets loaded and removed from the memory these spaces get broken into small pieces of memory that it can't be allocated to the coming processes. This problem is called <strong>fragmentation</strong>.
4. [What is the difference between linking and binding?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26193559/what-is-the-difference-between-linking-and-binding)<br>

5. [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
   In operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. GeekforGeeks once again came to the rescue with this very concise article!
6. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
   An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Demand paging necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a **frame allocation algorithm**.
7. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
   **Thrashing** is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual procssing done is very negligible. Turns out, thrashing isn't that one *thrashing* we thought...

## Week 6
1. [States of a Process in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems)<br>

6. [Multi-Threading Models](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multi-threading-models)<br>
   Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These parts are known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process. Therefore, multithread leads to maximum utilization of the CPU by multitasking.
7. [PThread Programming Tutorial](https://medium.com/adamedelwiess/operating-system-8-a-tutorial-for-the-pthread-programming-bf8004e36e70)<br>
   Birrel’s paper talked about threads :in a general way. However, PThreads is a very concrete multithreading system and it is the default standard in the UNIX system. PThreads stands for POSIX threads, and POSIX means Portable Operating System Interface, which is a kind of interface that the operating system needs to support. Within POSIX, PThreads describes the threading APIs the operating system needs to support.

## Week 8
1. [Difference Between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling in OS](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling-in-os.html)<br>
   The basic difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling is that in preemptive scheduling the CPU is allocated to the processes for the limited time. While in Non-preemptive scheduling, the CPU is allocated to the process till it terminates or switches to waiting state.
2. [More on Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
   Following the last number, GeekforGeeks also made a conncise article about scheduling! Let's take a quick read!

4. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
   CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.
5. [Processes and Threads](https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/os/processes-and-threads.html)<br>
   A process is an instance of program execution. This means, for example, that if you open up two browser windows then you have two processes, even though they are running the same program. Let's take a look!
6. [Difference between Process and Threads](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)<br>
